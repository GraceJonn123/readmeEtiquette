I. HOW TO USE THESE CD-ROMS or DVD-ROMs
The files on these CD-ROMs or DVD-ROMs are in JPEG, MPEG, Microsoft PowerPoint,
QuickTime, Flash, PDF, and Shockwave formats. You must have Office 2000 or
higher on your computer to use these files.

II. STARTING THE CD-ROMS or DVD-ROMs

WINDOWS
Insert the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM into the CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive. If you have Autorun turned on,
the installer should launch automatically. If it does not, follow these
steps:   
   1. Navigate through My Computer to your default CD-ROM drive.
   2. Right-click on the disc icon, and choose Open.
   3. Double-click on the MediaManager.exe icon; this will launch the
Media Manager 2.1 application.

MACINTOSH
If you have Firefox set as your default Internet browser, please launch
the browser and keep it running in the background while using the media
manager product.
   1. Insert the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM into the CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive. Double-click the
OSX_starter icon.
   2. The application may take 30-40 seconds to load. For faster startup,

double-click the MediaManager icon. You will need to keep the disc in your
computer's CD-ROM drive.

V. KNOWN ISSUES AND WORKAROUNDS
On Macintosh computers running Mozilla Browsers (i.e., Firefox or
Netscape) set as default, multimedia previews may fail to launch. If this
occurs, keep Firefox running in the background. The Media Manager 2.1
application will not launch on Macintosh computers running OS 10.2.0.

When loading for the first time, please close all other applications and 
make sure that Autorun is enabled.  The media manager may be slow to 
load the first time it is run.

On Macintosh computers running OSX version 10.4 with Office 2004 version
11.2, Quiz Show PowerPoint files might not open or function properly. To
correct the problem, it is recommended that you upgrade your software to
Office 2004 version 11.3.

Note to Windows Vista users: When the Media Manager disc is inserted, Windows
Vista may return a message that reads: Publisher not specified. Simply click
"Run MediaManager.exe" to launch the Media Manager. 

Note to Windows Vista users: When inserting the Media Manager disc and/or after
experiencing the known issue above, an XUL Runner message window may be
presented. To run the Media Manager, please click "OK" to exit the window and
then re-insert the disc.

Note to Windows Vista users: If you experience problems with QuickTime movies
while running Vista, please upgrade to the latest version of QuickTime available
from www.apple.com/quicktime (note: this applies to versions of Quicktime
7.0.3.25 and earlier).

Note to Windows Vista Office 2007 users: If you experience problems opening 
the Test Bank Word files and Word has appeared to crash or "hang", please 
re-install your network printer driver or switch the default printer to a 
local printer. To switch to a local printer or to install a local printer 
driver please see the help files that came with your computer.

Note to Windows Vista Office 2004 users: On some systems running Vista and Office 2004, hyperlinks within prepared lecture outlines do not function properly.

Note to users of QuickTime for Windows: If MPEG-format videos do not seem
to play correctly, you can ensure proper playback by taking the following
steps:
   1. Open the QuickTime control panel.
   2. Select "Video Settings" from the pull-down menu.
   3. Click on the "Safe Mode (GDI Only)" radio button.
   4. Close the QuickTime control panel.
   5. Reboot your system.

Note to users of Quicktime 6.5.2 for Windows: If you
experience difficulty playing .mov files, it is recommended that you upgrade
to Quicktime 7.1 or higher.

Note to users of Flash 7: Although Flash 7 meets the systems requirements
of this Media Manager, you may experience problems running isolated
animations and may need to upgrade Flash 8 or 9.

Note to users of Microsoft Office Professional Enterprise Edition 2003: IP
PowerPoint files may not run properly in the Microsoft Office 2003 version of
PowerPoint. Please upgrade to service pack 1 or 2, or install a more
current version of PowerPoint.

Note to users of IP Slides: Some Shockwave animations may not run properly
if you are running Firefox 2.0/Shockwave 8. Please use Internet
Explorer on the PC or Safari on the Mac.

Note to users of Apple Intel-based Macintosh computers (information below
current as of 4/07 and subject to change without Publisher's notice): To
use InterActive Physiology (IP) links, you must have the Shockwave plug-in
installed and the browser running in Rosetta Emulation Mode. In order to
play other types of multimedia the Rosetta Emulation Mode must be turned
off. Shockwave (which is the required player for IP) is not a native Intel
Macintosh browser plug-in at this time. Adobe is aware of this issue and
plans to release a native Shockwave Player that does not require using the
browser's Rosetta Emulation Mode. Please check Adobe's website
(www.adobe.com) for future Shockwave updates.

By default, Safari and Firefox run in native mode on the new Intel-based
Macs and therefore you must follow a few simple steps to run these
applications in Rosetta Emulation Mode:

To Launch a Browser in Rosetta Emulation Mode:
   1. Quit out of the browser.
   2. Go to your Applications folder and control-click on the browser
application bundle.
   3. In the context menu that appears select Get Info.
   4. Under the General heading of the Info dialog select "Open using Rosetta".
   5. Close the Info dialog box.

After you complete the above steps the browser will now run in Rosetta
Emulation Mode thus allowing you to install and use the Shockwave Player.

To turn off Rosetta: follow steps 1-5 and deselect "Open using Rosetta".

Note to users of on Apple Intel-based Macintosh computers running OSX10.5 with Microsoft Office 2004: If you experience problems with Word 2004 not running properly, it may be an issue with a Unix window system called X11. Upgrading to OSX 10.5.1 or higher and updating Office 2004 to 11.3.9 or higher, may resolve the issue.  If these upgrades do not fix the issue, then removing X11 from the system will solve the problem. To do this you must perform a clean install of OSX 10.5, selecting the custom option and do not install X11. Another known Office 2004 OSX 10.5 issue is that when previewing a word document in the Media Manager, the file opens in the Text Edit application rather than Microsoft Word. Workaround: please re-install or update Office 2004 to re-associate word files with Word 2004. If this does not work, please see the help files that came with your computer about associating file types with applications.
